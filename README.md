# GEOG3050
This repository demonstrates my geospatial programming work done in GEOG3050. I am a 4th year Computer Science and Geographic information Science Student.
Many of these files use arcpy functions in order to create fast GIS work flow solutions.

I enjoy coding, art, and geography and hope to apply my skills to interesting problem sets.
